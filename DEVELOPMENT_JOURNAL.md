- DevOps: Docker + Docker Compose

---

## 🏗️ PHASE 1: Foundation & Architecture

### 📝 Entry 1.1: Project Structure Setup
**Date**: Implementation Day 1

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Random file organization leads to spaghetti code
- Hard to find components when project grows
- Mixing different responsibilities in same files

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Organized directory structure following **Layered Architecture**:
```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── models/          # Data layer (database entities)
│   ├── schemas/         # API contracts (request/response)
│   ├── repositories/    # Data access abstraction
│   ├── services/        # Business logic
│   └── api/            # Presentation layer (endpoints)
├── tests/              # Isolated testing
└── requirements.txt    # Dependency management
```

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each folder has single responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easy to find and modify components
- **Scalability**: Can grow without becoming messy
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different layers

**🟡 HOW**: 
- **Models**: Define database entities (Book class)
- **Schemas**: Define API input/output contracts
- **Repositories**: Abstract database operations behind interfaces
- **Services**: Implement business rules and logic
- **API**: Handle HTTP requests/responses

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood Layered Architecture principle
- Learned importance of folder organization
- Practiced dependency management with virtual environments

---

### 📝 Entry 1.2: Domain Design & Architecture Planning
**Date**: Implementation Day 2

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Building without clear domain understanding leads to poor design
- Components talking directly creates tight coupling
- No clear boundaries between responsibilities

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Designed 3-layer architecture with clear boundaries:
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Presentation  │ ← API endpoints, HTTP handling
├─────────────────┤
│    Business     │ ← Services, validation, business rules
├──────────��──────┤
│      Data       │ ← Models, repositories, database access
└─────────────────┘
```

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
- **Flexibility**: Can swap implementations (e.g., SQLite → PostgreSQL)
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each layer has specific responsibilities

**🟡 HOW**: 
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user input, HTTP requests, responses
- **Business Layer**: Validates data, applies business rules, coordinates operations
- **Data Layer**: Manages database connections, executes queries, handles persistence

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood Dependency Inversion Principle
- Learned importance of architectural boundaries
- Practiced domain modeling with Book entity

---

## 🔧 PHASE 2: Backend Development

### 📝 Entry 2.1: Data Layer Implementation
**Date**: Implementation Day 3

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Direct database queries scattered throughout code
- Hard to change database schema
- No clear data access patterns

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Implemented SQLAlchemy models and database setup:
- `Book` model with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Database connection factory
- Pydantic schemas for API contracts

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **ORM Benefits**: Object-relational mapping simplifies database operations
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic ensures data validation
- **Schema Evolution**: SQLAlchemy handles database changes
- **Factory Pattern**: Centralized database session creation

**🟡 HOW**: 
```python
# Model (Database Entity)
class Book(Base):
    __tablename__ = "books"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String, nullable=False)
    author = Column(String, nullable=False)

# Schema (API Contract)
class BookCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    author: str

# Factory (Session Creation)
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood ORM pattern and benefits
- Learned difference between models (database) and schemas (API)
- Practiced Factory pattern for resource management

---

### 📝 Entry 2.2: Repository Pattern Implementation
**Date**: Implementation Day 4

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Services directly use SQLAlchemy → tight coupling
- Hard to test business logic
- Cannot switch database technologies easily

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Implemented Repository Pattern with interface:
```python
# Abstract Interface
class BookRepositoryInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create(self, book: Book) -> Book: pass
    
# Concrete Implementation
class SQLBookRepository(BookRepositoryInterface):
    def create(self, book: Book) -> Book:
        # SQLAlchemy implementation
```

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **Dependency Inversion**: Business layer depends on interface, not implementation
- **Testability**: Easy to mock repository for unit tests
- **Flexibility**: Can switch from SQL → NoSQL without changing business logic
- **Single Responsibility**: Repository only handles data access

**🟡 HOW**: 
- **Interface**: Defines contract (what operations are available)
- **Implementation**: Provides specific technology implementation (SQLAlchemy)
- **Injection**: FastAPI injects repository into endpoints via `Depends()`

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Mastered Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Understood interface-based programming
- Learned dependency injection benefits

---

### 📝 Entry 2.3: API Layer & FastAPI Setup
**Date**: Implementation Day 5

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Manual HTTP handling is error-prone
- No API documentation
- Difficult to validate request/response data

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Implemented FastAPI with REST endpoints:
- GET /books (list all books)
- POST /books (create new book)
- GET /books/{id} (get specific book)
- PUT /books/{id} (update book)
- DELETE /books/{id} (delete book)

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **REST Principles**: Standardized HTTP operations
- **Auto Documentation**: Swagger UI generates interactive docs
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic validates all input/output
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns

**🟡 HOW**: 
```python
@app.post("/books", response_model=BookResponse)
async def create_book(
    book: BookCreate,  # Pydantic validates input
    repo: BookRepositoryInterface = Depends(get_book_repository)  # DI
):
    return repo.create(Book(**book.dict()))
```

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood RESTful API design principles
- Learned FastAPI's dependency injection system
- Practiced automatic API documentation generation

---

### 📝 Entry 2.4: Service Layer Introduction & Modular API Refactor
**Date**: Implementation Day 10

**🔴 PROBLEM**:
- Endpoints were directly orchestrating repository operations (thin HTTP ↔ data coupling)
- Harder to evolve business rules without touching presentation layer
- All endpoints kept in main.py reducing modularity and test clarity

**🔵 WHAT**:
- Introduced dedicated `BookService` encapsulating business logic and orchestration
- Added `app/api/books.py` with an `APIRouter` to modularize book endpoints
- Centralized dependency providers in `app/api/dependencies.py`
- Refactored endpoints to depend on service instead of repository directly

**🟢 WHY**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: HTTP layer now delegates logic to service
- **Extensibility**: Future rules (validation, events, caching) go into service without touching controllers
- **Testability**: Service can be unit tested independently (next planned enhancement)
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner `main.py`, easier to add more resource routers later
- **Alignment with Layered Architecture**: Restores clear Presentation → Business → Data flow

**🟡 HOW**:
```python
# Dependency (dependencies.py)
def get_book_service(repo: BookRepositoryInterface = Depends(get_book_repository)) -> BookService:
    return BookService(repo)

# Service (book_service.py)
class BookService:
    def search_books(...):
        if filters: return repo.search(...)
        return repo.get_all(...)

# Router (books.py)
@router.get('/books')
async def get_books(..., service: BookService = Depends(get_book_service)):
    return service.search_books(...)
```

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood benefits of an explicit service layer over direct repository usage
- Practiced modular API design with `APIRouter`
- Strengthened dependency injection chain (DB → Repository → Service → Endpoint)
- Prepared ground for future cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, auth)

            component: oComponent,
            async: true
        }).placeAt("content");
    });
});
```

**Configuration Structure**:
- `manifest.json`: Application metadata and routing configuration

## 🎓 Complete Pattern Library Learned

### Design Patterns
1. **Factory Pattern**: Database session creation, model factories
2. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction with interfaces
3. **Service Layer Pattern**: API communication abstraction
4. **MVC Pattern**: Complete separation of concerns in frontend

### Architecture Patterns
1. **Layered Architecture**: Backend presentation, business, data layers
2. **Component Architecture**: SAPUI5 modular component structure
3. **REST API Architecture**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods

### Development Patterns
1. **Migration Pattern**: Database version control and schema evolution
2. **Test Database Isolation**: Clean testing environments
3. **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI and SAPUI5 dependency management
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling across all layers

## 🔜 Upcoming / Planned Enhancements
(Tracked but not yet implemented, prioritized for practicality.)
1. Health Endpoint (`/health`): Liveness + optional DB readiness probe
2. Service Layer Tests: Direct unit tests for `BookService`
3. Structured Logging: Consistent log formatter + request correlation ID
4. Error Handling Middleware: Normalize error responses (problem+detail)
5. Dockerization (Phase 6 milestones) + Postgres switch readiness
6. Optional API Versioning (`/api/v1`) once stability needed
7. Pagination Envelope (return total + items) if frontend requires richer metadata
8. Observability Hooks: Placeholders for metrics (timers on repository calls)

These items remain intentionally separate from core CRUD to keep current scope lean while enabling incremental evolution.

**Current Focus Suggestion**: Implement lightweight `/health` + service unit tests before containerization.
