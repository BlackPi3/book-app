- Database: SQLite (development) → PostgreSQL (production)
- Frontend: SAPUI5 with TypeScript
- DevOps: Docker + Docker Compose

---

## 🏗️ PHASE 1: Foundation & Architecture

### 📝 Entry 1.1: Project Structure Setup
**Date**: Implementation Day 1

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Random file organization leads to spaghetti code
- Hard to find components when project grows
- Mixing different responsibilities in same files

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Organized directory structure following **Layered Architecture**:
```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── models/          # Data layer (database entities)
│   ├── schemas/         # API contracts (request/response)
│   ├── repositories/    # Data access abstraction
│   ├── services/        # Business logic
│   └── api/            # Presentation layer (endpoints)
├── tests/              # Isolated testing
└── requirements.txt    # Dependency management
```

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each folder has single responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easy to find and modify components
- **Scalability**: Can grow without becoming messy
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different layers

**🟡 HOW**: 
- **Models**: Define database entities (Book class)
- **Schemas**: Define API input/output contracts
- **Repositories**: Abstract database operations behind interfaces
- **Services**: Implement business rules and logic
- **API**: Handle HTTP requests/responses

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood Layered Architecture principle
- Learned importance of folder organization
- Practiced dependency management with virtual environments

### 📝 Entry 1.2: Domain Design & Architecture Planning
**Date**: Implementation Day 2

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Building without clear domain understanding leads to poor design
- Components talking directly creates tight coupling
- No clear boundaries between responsibilities

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Designed 3-layer architecture with clear boundaries:
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Presentation  │ ← API endpoints, HTTP handling
├─────────────────┤
│    Business     │ ← Services, validation, business rules
├─────────────────┤
│      Data       │ ← Models, repositories, database access
└─────────────────┘
```

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently
- **Flexibility**: Can swap implementations (e.g., SQLite → PostgreSQL)
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each layer has specific responsibilities

**🟡 HOW**: 
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user input, HTTP requests, responses
- **Business Layer**: Validates data, applies business rules, coordinates operations
- **Data Layer**: Manages database connections, executes queries, handles persistence

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood Dependency Inversion Principle
- Learned importance of architectural boundaries
- Practiced domain modeling with Book entity

## 🔧 PHASE 2: Backend Development

### 📝 Entry 2.1: Data Layer Implementation
**Date**: Implementation Day 3

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Direct database queries scattered throughout code
- Hard to change database schema
- No clear data access patterns

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Implemented SQLAlchemy models and database setup:
- `Book` model with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Database connection factory
- Pydantic schemas for API contracts

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **ORM Benefits**: Object-relational mapping simplifies database operations
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic ensures data validation
- **Schema Evolution**: SQLAlchemy handles database changes
- **Factory Pattern**: Centralized database session creation

**🟡 HOW**: 
```python
# Model (Database Entity)
class Book(Base):
    __tablename__ = "books"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = Column(String, nullable=False)
    author = Column(String, nullable=False)

# Schema (API Contract)
class BookCreate(BaseModel):
    title: str
    author: str

# Factory (Session Creation)
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood ORM pattern and benefits
- Learned difference between models (database) and schemas (API)
- Practiced Factory pattern for resource management

---

### 📝 Entry 2.2: Repository Pattern Implementation
**Date**: Implementation Day 4

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Services directly use SQLAlchemy → tight coupling
- Hard to test business logic
- Cannot switch database technologies easily

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Implemented Repository Pattern with interface:
```python
# Abstract Interface
class BookRepositoryInterface(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def create(self, book: Book) -> Book: pass
    
# Concrete Implementation
class SQLBookRepository(BookRepositoryInterface):
    def create(self, book: Book) -> Book:
        # SQLAlchemy implementation
```

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **Dependency Inversion**: Business layer depends on interface, not implementation
- **Testability**: Easy to mock repository for unit tests
- **Flexibility**: Can switch from SQL → NoSQL without changing business logic
- **Single Responsibility**: Repository only handles data access

**🟡 HOW**: 
- **Interface**: Defines contract (what operations are available)
- **Implementation**: Provides specific technology implementation (SQLAlchemy)
- **Injection**: FastAPI injects repository into endpoints via `Depends()`

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Mastered Repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Understood interface-based programming
- Learned dependency injection benefits

---

### 📝 Entry 2.3: API Layer & FastAPI Setup
**Date**: Implementation Day 5

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Manual HTTP handling is error-prone
- No API documentation
- Difficult to validate request/response data

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Implemented FastAPI with REST endpoints:
- GET /books (list all books)
- POST /books (create new book)
- GET /books/{id} (get specific book)
- PUT /books/{id} (update book)
- DELETE /books/{id} (delete book)

**🟢 WHY**: 
- **REST Principles**: Standardized HTTP operations
- **Auto Documentation**: Swagger UI generates interactive docs
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic validates all input/output
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns

**🟡 HOW**: 
```python
@app.post("/books", response_model=BookResponse)
async def create_book(
    book: BookCreate,  # Pydantic validates input
    repo: BookRepositoryInterface = Depends(get_book_repository)  # DI
):
    return repo.create(Book(**book.dict()))
```

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood RESTful API design principles
- Learned FastAPI's dependency injection system
- Practiced automatic API documentation generation

## 🗄️ PHASE 3: Database & Data Layer

### 📝 Entry 3.1: Database Migrations & Seeding
**Date**: Implementation Day 6

**🔴 PROBLEM**: 
- Database schema changes are manual and error-prone
- Team members have different database structures
- No way to rollback database changes
- Production deployments risk data loss
- Need sample data for development/testing

**🔵 WHAT**: 
Implemented Alembic migration system and database seeding:
- Migration versioning system
- Automatic schema change detection
- Sample data seeding script
- Upgrade/downgrade capabilities

**🟢 WHY - Migration Pattern**: 
Even for solo projects, migrations are essential because:
- **Version Control**: Track database changes like code changes
- **Reproducibility**: Same database structure across environments
- **Deployment Safety**: Automated, tested database updates
- **Professional Practice**: Industry standard for database management
- **Future-Proofing**: When you do work with teams, you'll know the pattern

**🟢 WHY - Seeding Pattern**: 
- **Development Efficiency**: Don't manually create test data
- **Consistent Testing**: Same sample data for all developers
- **Demo Readiness**: Application works immediately with realistic data

**🟡 HOW**: 
```python
# Migration (schema change)
def upgrade():
    op.create_table('books',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), primary_key=True),
        sa.Column('title', sa.String(), nullable=False),
        sa.Column('author', sa.String(), nullable=False)
    )

# Seeding (sample data)
def seed_database():
    books = [Book(title="Clean Code", author="Robert Martin"), ...]
    for book in books:
        db.add(book)
    db.commit()
```

**📊 Learning Outcomes**:
- Understood migration pattern for database versioning
- Learned difference between schema changes (migrations) and data population (seeding)
- Practiced professional database management workflows
